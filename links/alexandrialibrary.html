<blockquote>
<p>Library of Alexandria, the most famous library of Classical antiquity. It formed part of the research institute at Alexandria in Egypt that is known as the Museum, or the Alexandrian Museum.</p>

<p>The Alexandrian library and museum were founded and maintained by the long succession of Ptolemies in Egypt from the beginning of the 3rd century bce. The library's initial organization was the work of Demetrius of Phaleron, who was familiar with the achievements of the library at Athens. Both the museum and the library were organized in faculties, with a president-priest at the head and the salaries of the staff paid by the Egyptian king. A subsidiary "daughter library" was established about 235 bce by Ptolemy III Euergetes in the Temple of Serapis (Serapeum), the main museum and library being located in the palace precincts, in the district known as the Brucheium. The exact location and the layout of the library and the museum are uncertain, however. The library is said to have encompassed an area in which to walk, gardens, a large dining hall, a reading room, lecture halls, and meeting rooms. Together with the museum, which supported and housed a number of scholars, the library was clearly as much a cultural centre and intellectual meeting place as a repository and research resource.</p>

<p>It was asserted that the library was destroyed in a great fire, although there are contestants of this view who believe that the building of the library was long destroyed at the time of the fire.</p>
