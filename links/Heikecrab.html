<blockquote>
<p>According to Japanese folklore, the Heikegani crabs contain the souls of the Heike samurai warriors who were slain at the Battle of Dan-no-ura in 1185 AD, a war over the Japanese imperial throne. The story goes that the Heike samurai, reincarnated into the Heikegani crab, were showing their allegiance to their clan by donning a fierce mask on their shells.  The battle of Dan-no-ura, immortalized in the Heike Monogatari (the Tale of Heike) was a pivotal moment in Japan's history, which established the first shogunate (military dictatorship) and resulted in the death of a child emperor.</p>

<p>Heikegani were used as an example of unintentional artificial selection. </p>
